- Participation in the competition will be individual.
- It's mandatory that all devs participate except the jury.
- The jury will be made up of Antonio Gutiérrez, Carlos Escribano, Enrique Martínez and Manuel Dominguez.
- **When the time available to code the application is over, the code will be pushed to the dev's own fork. If the application is not finished, what has been done will be uploaded.**
- Each participant will show the application to the member of the jury he's assigned to for evaluation.

## Awards

The prizes will be Amazon gift cards (no more than one prize per project):

- **King Award:** €100
- **Queen Award:** €50
- **Bishop Award:** €50

## Project requisites

- Create a web application to play chess with another player in real time ([chess rules in Spanish](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyes_del_ajedrez)).
- You must use Phoenix and Phoenix LiveView.
- There must be a graphical UI to perform chess movements.
- UI must be updated in real time.
- UI must display which player won the game, if any.
- Apart from the board, feel free to add user/game feedback and to decide how to display it.
- Any other enhancement will be taken into account for the final score.

### Scope

The idea is that two players should be able to play a single game. You can make reasonable simplifications, like:

- Create a game by accessing a random URL like `/game/:game_name`. Sharing that URL the other player would be able to join the game.
- The user that creates the game uses the white pieces.

### Chess Board

- There's a pre-defined chess board with styles you can use as a starting point. It looks like the one in the image below.
- Final HTML is provided, you are responsible of generating the HTML based on your project's data models.
